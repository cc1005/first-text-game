You have stopped at the crest of a slight hill. 
A few hundred metres in front of you there is a glow illuminating the hills on either side of the valley, punctuating the dark woods that rise on either side of the road. 
If you hold your breath, you think you can hear a distant humming coming from the location of the lights. 

Do you:
1. Move into the forest at the side of the road so you can try and approach unseen.
2. Continue on the road for another hundred metres to see if you can see what is making the glow.
3. Turn back the way you came.
