  storyText: 'You creep into the trees. As you move closer to the glow, you begin
    to see glimpses of a large concrete structure through the trees. It is a large
    wall, around 12 feet high, stretching from one side of the valley to the other.


    You
    arrive at the wall. You feel anxious of being spotted, but you know you are still
    covered by the trees. There is a grate in front of you. Do you want to try and
    pry it open to get through?


    1: Yes.

    2: No. '
