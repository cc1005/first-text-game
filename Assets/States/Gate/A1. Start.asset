  storyText: "You have stopped at the crest of a slight hill. \r\nA few hundred metres
    in front of you there is a glow illuminating the hills on either side of the
    valley, punctuating the dark woods that rise on either side of the road. \r\nIf
    you hold your breath, you think you can hear a distant humming coming from the
    location of the lights. \r\n\r\nDo you:\r\n1. Move into the forest at the side
    of the road so you can try and approach unseen.\r\n2. Continue on the road for
    another hundred metres to see if you can see what is making the glow.\r\n3. Turn
    back the way you came. "
